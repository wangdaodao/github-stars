Pake
====

**Turn any webpage into a desktop app with Rust _with ease_.**

Pake supports Mac, Windows, and Linux. Check out README for Popular Packages, Command-Line Packaging, and Customized Development information. Feel free to share your suggestions in Discussions.

Features
--------

-   üöÄ With Rust Tauri, Pake is much more lightweight and faster than JS-based frameworks.
-   üì¶ Battery-included package ‚Äî shortcut pass-through, immersive windows, and minimalist customization.
-   üñ±Ô∏è Smart right-click context menus with download support for images, videos, and files.
-   üëª Pake is just a simple tool ‚Äî replaces the old bundle approach with Tauri (though PWA is also a good alternative).

Before starting
---------------

1.  **For beginners**: Play with Popular Packages to find out Pake's capabilities, or try to pack your application with GitHub Actions. Don't hesitate to reach for assistance at Discussion!
2.  **For developers**: ‚ÄúCommand-Line Packaging‚Äù supports macOS fully. For Windows/Linux users, it requires some tinkering. Configure your environment before getting started.
3.  **For hackers**: For people who are good at both front-end development and Rust, how about customizing your apps' function more with the following Customized Development?

Command-Line Packaging
----------------------

**Pake provides a command line tool, making the flow of package customization quicker and easier. See the CLI usage guide for more information.**

# Recommended (pnpm)
pnpm install -g pake-cli

# Alternative (npm)
npm install -g pake-cli

# Command usage
pake url \[OPTIONS\]...

# Feel free to play with Pake! It might take a while to prepare the environment the first time you launch Pake.
pake https://weekly.tw93.fun --name Weekly --hide-title-bar

If you are new to the command line, you can compile packages online with _GitHub Actions_. See our documentation for detailed guides.

Development
-----------

Prepare your environment before starting. Make sure you have Rust `>=1.89` and Node `>=18` (e.g., `22.11.0`) installed on your computer. _Note: Latest stable versions are recommended._ For installation guidance, see Tauri documentation.

If you are unfamiliar with these, it is better to try out the above tool to pack with one click.

# Install dependencies
pnpm i

# Local development (right-click to open debug mode)
pnpm run dev

# Build application
pnpm run build

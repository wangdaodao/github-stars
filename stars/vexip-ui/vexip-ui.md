Vexip UI
========

Highly customizability, full TypeScript, performance pretty good

If you have created any awesome thing with Vexip UI and would like to showcase it on the official website, you can contact me. If you would like to contribute code, you are very welcome!

**English** | 中文 \[含技术支持群\]

Vexip (pronounced `/ˈvesɪp/`) UI provides a series of out-of-box components.

This library is written using **composition API**, and the components are designed and written in a traditional Vue way possible, with full **TypeScript** support.

Almost all **default property values** of each component can be easily customized through injected configurations, making it easy to achieve customization.

Meanwhile, the component code pays great attention to reducing the threshold of **source code reading**, and the code layout is as close as possible to the habits of daily business code, avoiding fancy and showy code.

Currently, there are **78** components, some of which may be familiar to you, and even better, while others may brighten your eyes.

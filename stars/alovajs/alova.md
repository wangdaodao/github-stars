Is there any difference?
------------------------

Unlike libraries such as `@tanstack/react-query`, `swrjs`, and `useRequest` from `ahooks`, alova aims to make requests very simple and maintain more efficient data interaction. We consider both developers and App users. For developers, alova provides them with the ultimate user experience, and for application users, they can enjoy the smooth experience brought by alova's high-performance data interaction.

I have a problem with GitHub Desktop
------------------------------------

Note: The GitHub Desktop Code of Conduct applies in all interactions relating to the GitHub Desktop project.

First, please search the open issues and closed issues to see if your issue hasn't already been reported (it may also be fixed).

There is also a list of known issues that are being tracked against Desktop, and some of these issues have workarounds.

If you can't find an issue that matches what you're seeing, open a new issue, choose the right template and provide us with enough information to investigate further.

The issue I reported isn't fixed yet. What can I do?
----------------------------------------------------

If nobody has responded to your issue in a few days, you're welcome to respond to it with a friendly ping in the issue. Please do not respond more than a second time if nobody has responded. The GitHub Desktop maintainers are constrained in time and resources, and diagnosing individual configurations can be difficult and time consuming. While we'll try to at least get you pointed in the right direction, we can't guarantee we'll be able to dig too deeply into any one person's issue.

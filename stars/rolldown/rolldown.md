Rolldown
========

Rolldown is a JavaScript/TypeScript bundler written in Rust intended to serve as the future bundler used in Vite. It provides Rollup-compatible APIs and plugin interface, but will be more similar to esbuild in scope.

For more information, please check out the documentation at rolldown.rs.

📖Introduction
==============

micro-app is a micro front-end framework launched by JD Retail. It renders based on webcomponent-like and realizes the micro front-end from component thinking, it aiming to reduce the difficulty of getting started and improve work efficiency.

It is the lowest cost framework for accessing micro front-end, and provides a series of perfect functions such as JS sandbox, style isolation, element isolation, preloading, resource address completion, plugin system, data communication and so on.

micro-app has no restrictions on the front-end framework, and any framework can be used as a base application to embed any type of micro application of the framework.

FAQ
===

What are the advantages of micro-app? It is easy to use and low invasive. It only needs to change a small amount of code to access the micro front-end, and provides rich functions at the same time. How compatible? The micro-app relies on two newer APIs, CustomElements and Proxy.

For browsers that do not support CustomElements, they can be compatible by introducing polyfills. For details, please refer to: webcomponents/polyfills。

However, Proxy is not compatible for the time being, so the micro-app cannot be run on browsers that do not support Proxy.

Browser compatibility can be viewed: Can I Use

The general is as follows:

-   desktop: Except IE browser, other browsers are basically compatible.
-   mobile: ios10+、android5+

Must micro applications support cross-domain? yes!

If it is a development environment, you can set headers in webpack-dev-server to support cross-domain.

devServer: {
  headers: {
    'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '\*',
  },
}

If it is a production environment, you can support cross-domain through Configuration nginx.

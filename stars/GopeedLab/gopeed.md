👨‍💻 Development
-----------------

This project is divided into two parts, the front end uses `flutter`, the back end uses `Golang`, and the two sides communicate through the `http` protocol. On the unix system, `unix socket` is used, and on the windows system, `tcp` protocol is used.

> The front code is located in the `ui/flutter` directory.

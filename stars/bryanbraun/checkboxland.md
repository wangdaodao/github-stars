Checkboxland
============

Checkboxland is a JavaScript library for rendering anything as HTML checkboxes.

You can use it to display animations, text, images, video, and arbitrary data. It also supports plugins, so you can add your own APIs.

Checkboxland is dependency-free, framework-agnostic, and fun! ðŸ™ƒ

**For more details see the docs.**

Setup
-----

Install this package via npm:

```
npm install checkboxland
```

Example
-------

Import it into your application, and create a checkbox grid:

```
import { Checkboxland } from 'checkboxland';

const cbl = new Checkboxland({ dimensions: '8x7', selector: '#my-container' });

// Create a data representation of the heart.
const heart = [
  [0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0],
  [1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1],
  [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
  [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
  [0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0],
  [0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0],
  [0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0],
];

// This updates the grid with the data we provided.
cbl.setData(heart);
```

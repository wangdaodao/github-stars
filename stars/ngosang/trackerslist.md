====================

Updated list of public BitTorrent trackers

### Lists

_These lists are automatically updated every day. Last update 2024/12/14:_

-   trackers\_best (20 trackers) => link / mirror / mirror 2
-   trackers\_all (129 trackers) => link / mirror / mirror 2
-   trackers\_all\_udp (58 trackers) => link / mirror / mirror 2
-   trackers\_all\_http (58 trackers) => link / mirror / mirror 2
-   trackers\_all\_https (13 trackers) => link / mirror / mirror 2
-   trackers\_all\_ws (1 trackers) => link / mirror / mirror 2

Are you having DNS problems? These lists contain the same trackers but with IP addresses instead of domains:

-   trackers\_best\_ip (20 trackers) => link / mirror / mirror 2
-   trackers\_all\_ip (76 trackers) => link / mirror / mirror 2

### Notes

-   A bot automatically checks the trackers and updates the lists.
-   Trackers with the same domain or pointing to the same IP address are removed. Check out the blacklist.
-   Trackers are sorted by popularity and latency (from best to worst).
-   WebSocket trackers (AKA WebTorrent, ws, wss) are supported by few clients. More info.
-   Lists with IP addresses can be shorter because Cloudflare IPs are removed.

Minimalist Web Notepad
======================

This is an open-source clone of the now-defunct notepad.cc: "a piece of paper in the cloud".

See demo at https://notes.orga.cat or https://notes.orga.cat/whatever.

Installation
------------

Make sure the web server is allowed to write to the `_tmp` directory.

### On Apache

You may need to enable mod\_rewrite and allow `.htaccess` files in your site configuration. See How To Set Up mod\_rewrite for Apache.

### On Nginx

To enable URL rewriting, put something like this in your configuration file:

If the project resides in the root directory:

```
location / {
    rewrite ^/([a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)$ /index.php?note=$1;
}
```

If the project resides in a subdirectory:

```
location ~* ^/notes/([a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)$ {
    try_files $uri /notes/index.php?note=$1;
}
```

If parameters need to be passed in Nginx (such as `?raw`), then `&$args` needs to be added to the end of the `$1` match:

```
location ~* ^/notes/([a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)$ {
    try_files $uri /notes/index.php?note=$1&$args;
}
```

Usage (CLI)
-----------

Using the command-line interface you can both save and retrieve notes. Here are some examples using `curl`:

Retrieve a note's content and save it to a local file:

```
curl https://example.com/notes/test > test.txt
```

Save specific text to a note:

```
curl https://example.com/notes/test -d 'hello,

welcome to my pad!
'
```

Save the content of a local file (e.g., `/etc/hosts`) to a note:

```
cat /etc/hosts | curl https://example.com/notes/hosts --data-binary @-
```

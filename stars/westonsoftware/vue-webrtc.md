Upgrading from V2 to V3
-----------------------

V3 of this component is a migration from Vue 2 to Vue 3. There is no new functionality yet. The older V2 will only be patched as needed and maintained as Vue 2.

Upgrading from V1 to V2
-----------------------

V2 of this component is mostly compatible with V1 but it completely replaces the internals with a new signaling server and a new SimplePeer client. Due to this, you will need to set the \[socketUrl\] to a new instance of the included .\\vue-webrtc-lobby socket server. There is a default instance that you are welcome to use but you should run your own. If you are using STUN and TURN settings, you will now need to set those in \[peerOptions\] .

Quick Start with Vue CLI
------------------------

```
vue create sample
cd sample
yarn install
npm install vue-webrtc --save
```

Now open the App.vue file and replace the HelloVue component with the code in the Usage section above.

```
npm run serve
```

See the /sample folder for a working project

Roadmap

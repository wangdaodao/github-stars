Molecule
========

### A lightweight Web IDE UI Framework

中文 | English | 한국어

The **Molecule** is a lightweight **Web IDE UI** framework which is built with React.js and inspired by the VSCode. We have designed the Extension APIs similar to the VSCode, to help developers extend the Workbench in an easier way. It's convenient to integrate the Molecule with React.js applications. It has been applied to many products in DTStack

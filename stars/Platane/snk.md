Generates a snake game from a github user contributions graph

Pull a github user's contribution graph. Make it a snake Game, generate a snake path where the cells get eaten in an orderly fashion.

Generate a gif or svg image.

Available as github action. It can automatically generate a new image each day. Which makes for great github profile readme

Usage
-----

**github action**

\- uses: Platane/snk@v3
  with:
    # github user name to read the contribution graph from (\*\*required\*\*)
    # using action context var \`github.repository\_owner\` or specified user
    github\_user\_name: ${{ github.repository\_owner }}

    # list of files to generate.
    # one file per line. Each output can be customized with options as query string.
    #
    #  supported options:
    #  - palette:     A preset of color, one of \[github, github-dark, github-light\]
    #  - color\_snake: Color of the snake
    #  - color\_dots:  Coma separated list of dots color.
    #                 The first one is 0 contribution, then it goes from the low contribution to the highest.
    #                 Exactly 5 colors are expected.
    outputs: |
      dist/github-snake.svg
      dist/github-snake-dark.svg?palette=github-dark
      dist/ocean.gif?color\_snake=orange&color\_dots=#bfd6f6,#8dbdff,#64a1f4,#4b91f1,#3c7dd9

example with cron job

If you are only interested in generating a svg, consider using this faster action: `uses: Platane/snk/svg-only@v3`

**dark mode**

For **dark mode** support on github, use this special syntax in your readme.

<picture\>
  <source media\="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset\="github-snake-dark.svg" />
  <source media\="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset\="github-snake.svg" />
  <img alt\="github-snake" src\="github-snake.svg" />
</picture\>

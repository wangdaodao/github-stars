Chili3D
=======

A web-based 3D CAD application for online model design and editing.

Overview
--------

Chili3D is an open-source, browser-based 3D CAD (Computer-Aided Design) application built with TypeScript. It achieves near-native performance by compiling OpenCascade (OCCT) to WebAssembly and integrating with Three.js, enabling powerful online modeling, editing, and rendering—all without the need for local installation.

You can access Chili3D online at:

-   Official website: chili3d.com
-   Cloudflare deployment: chili3d.pages.dev

Features
--------

### Modeling Tools

-   **Basic Shapes**: Create boxes, cylinders, cones, spheres, pyramids, and more
-   **2D Sketching**: Draw lines, arcs, circles, ellipses, rectangles, polygons, and Bezier curves
-   **Advanced Operations**:
    -   Boolean operations (union, difference, intersection)
    -   Extrusion and revolution
    -   Sweeping and lofting
    -   Offset surfaces
    -   Section creation

### Snapping and Tracking

-   **Object Snapping**: Precisely snap to geometric features (points, edges, faces)
-   **Workplane Snapping**: Snap to the current workplane for accurate planar operations
-   **Axis Tracking**: Create objects along tracked axes for precise alignment
-   **Feature Point Detection**: Automatically detect and snap to key geometric features
-   **Tracking Visualization**: Visual guides showing tracking lines and reference points

### Editing Tools

-   **Modification**: Chamfer, fillet, trim, break, split
-   **Transformation**: Move, rotate, mirror
-   **Advanced Editing**:
    -   Feature removal
    -   Sub-shape manipulation
    -   Explode compound objects

### Measurement Tools

-   Measure angles and lengths
-   Calculate the sum of length, area, and volume

### Document Management

-   Create, open, and save documents
-   Full undo/redo stack with transaction history
-   Import/export of industry-standard formats (STEP, IGES, BREP)

### User Interface

-   Office-style interface with contextual command organization
-   Hierarchical assembly management with flexible grouping capabilities
-   Dynamic workplane support
-   3D viewport with camera controls
-   Camera position recall

### Localization

-   **Multi-Language Interface**: Built-in internationalization (i18n) supporting seamless adaptation to global user bases
-   **Current Languages**: Chinese & English; contributions for additional languages are welcome

Technology Stack
----------------

-   **Frontend**: TypeScript, Three.js
-   **3D Engine**: OpenCascade (via WebAssembly)
-   **Build Tools**: Rspack
-   **Testing**: Jest

Getting Started
---------------

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js
-   npm

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository
    
    git clone https://github.com/xiangechen/chili3d.git
    cd chili3d
    
2.  Install dependencies
    
    npm install
    

### Development

Start the development server:

npm run dev # Launches at http://localhost:8080

### Building

Build the application:

npm run build

### Building wasm

if you want to build wasm by yourself, you can use the following commands:

1.  Set up WebAssembly dependencies(if you have not installed them yet)
    
    npm run setup:wasm
    
2.  Build the WebAssembly module:
    
    npm run build:wasm
    

Development Status
------------------

⚠️ **Early Development Notice**

Local development
-----------------

The local development server will run our examples app. The basic example will show any changes you've made to the codebase.

To run the local development server, first clone this repo.

Enable corepack to make sure you have the right version of `yarn`:

npm i -g corepack

Install dependencies:

yarn

Start the local development server:

yarn dev

Open the example project at `localhost:5420`.

Tips for AIs
------------

**Are you an AI agent?** If so, this monorepo has special `CONTEXT.md` files found throughout the repository that you can use to quickly build context while you work. Use your own tools to find and read these files, or use our helpful `context` script to locate and log the contents of the most relevant files.

To get started quickly, run:

yarn context

This will find and display the nearest CONTEXT.md file to help you understand the codebase. The `context` script supports several options:

-   `yarn context` - Show path to nearest CONTEXT.md from current directory
-   `yarn context ./foo/bar/baz.ts` - Show path to nearest CONTEXT.md for a specific file or directory
-   `yarn context -v` or `--verbose` - Show full content of nearest CONTEXT.md
-   `yarn context -r` or `--recursive` - Find all CONTEXT.md files in the repository

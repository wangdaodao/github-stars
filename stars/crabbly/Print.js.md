The library is written following the Javascript Standard code style. When running tests, we will also test for any style issues or warnings.

Automated tests are written using the Jasmine framework and Karma runner.

To run the automated tests:

npm run test

To manually test the library features:

npm start

This will serve `test\manual\test.html` and open `http://localhost:8080/test/manual` in your default browser.

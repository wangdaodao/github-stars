ü§ù Contributing
---------------

If you are eligible to use Follow, you are welcome to join the open source community to build together.

Before you start, make sure you have enabled Corepack. Corepack makes sure you are using the correct version (`packageManager` field in `package.json`) for package manager when you run corresponding commands.

corepack enable

Install dependencies.

pnpm install

### Develop in the browser

pnpm run dev:web

Then the browser opens `https://app.follow.is/__debug_proxy`Ôºåyou can access the online API environment to development and debugging.

### Develop in the electron

You need to fill in the required environment variables first.

cp .env.example .env

Then set `VITE_API_URL` to `https://api.follow.is` and run:

pnpm run dev

Since it is not very convenient to develop in Electron, the first way to develop and contribute is recommended at this stage.

Tip

If you can't log in to the app, copy the `__Secure-better-auth.session_token` in the cookie from your browser into the app.

### Not working ❓

-   If you are **unable to launch MAS** using the PowerShell method, please refer to **Method 2** listed above.
-   If MAS is launched and the script shows any errors, check for any troubleshooting steps mentioned in blue color and try to follow those.
-   If you have any issues, please feel free to reach out to us here.

Note

-   The IRM command in PowerShell downloads a script from a specified URL, and the IEX command executes it.
-   Always double-check the URL before executing the command and verify the source if manually downloading files.
-   Be cautious, as some spread malware disguised as MAS by using different URLs in the IRM command.

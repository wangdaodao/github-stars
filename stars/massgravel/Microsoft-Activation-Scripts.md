Download / How to use it?
-------------------------

### Method 1 - PowerShell (Windows 8 and later) ❤️

1.  Open PowerShell (Not CMD). To do that, right-click on the Windows start menu and select PowerShell or Terminal.
2.  Copy and paste the code below and press enter

```
irm https://get.activated.win | iex
```

1.  You will see the activation options. Choose (1) HWID for Windows activation. Choose (2) Ohook for Office activation.
2.  That's all.

More options

-   Alternatively, you can use the following (It will be deprecated in the future.)

```
irm https://massgrave.dev/get | iex
```

-   The URL `get.activated.win` might be blocked by some DNS services because it is a new domain.

Note

-   The IRM command in PowerShell downloads a script from a specified URL, and the IEX command executes it.
-   Always double-check the URL before executing the command and verify the source if manually downloading files.
-   Be cautious, as some spread malware disguised as MAS by using different URLs in the IRM command.

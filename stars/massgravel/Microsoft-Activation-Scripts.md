Tip

-   Some ISPs/DNS block access to our domains. You can bypass this by enabling DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) in your browser.
-   **Having trouble**‚ùìVisit our troubleshooting page or raise an issue on GitHub.

-   To run the scripts in unattended mode, check here.

Note

-   The IRM command in PowerShell downloads a script from a specified URL, and the IEX command executes it.
-   Always double-check the URL before executing the command and verify the source if manually downloading files.
-   Be cautious, as some spread malware disguised as MAS by using different URLs in the IRM command.

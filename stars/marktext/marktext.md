Supporting MarkText
-------------------

MarkText is an MIT licensed open source project, and the latest version will always be downloadable for free from the GitHub release page. MarkText is still in development, and its development is inseparable from all sponsors. I hope you join them:

-   Become a backer or sponsor on Patreon or One time donation
-   Become a backer or sponsor on Open Collective

##### What's the difference between Patreon and Open Collective?

Patreon: Funds will be directly sponsored to Luo Ran (@jocs) who created MarkText and continues to maintain it. Open Collective: All expenses are transparent. The funds will be used for the development and maintenance of MarkText, funding online and offline activities, and acquiring other necessary resources. Names and company logos of all sponsors (from both Patreon and Open Collective) will appear on the official website for MarkText and in its README.md file.

Why make another editor?
------------------------

1.  I love writing. I have used a lot of markdown editors, yet there is still not an editor that can fully meet my needs. I don't like to be disturbed when I write by some unbearable bug. **MarkText** uses virtual DOM to render pages which has the added benefits of being highly efficient and being open source. That way anyone who loves markdown and writing can use MarkText.
2.  As mentioned above, **MarkText** is completely free and open source and will be open source forever. We hope that all markdown lovers will contribute their own code and help develop **MarkText** into a popular markdown editor.
3.  There are many markdown editors and all have their own merits, some have features which others don't. It's difficult to satisfy each markdown users' needs but we hope **MarkText** will be able to satisfy each markdown user as much as possible. Although the latest **MarkText** is still not perfect, we will try to make it as best as we possibly can.

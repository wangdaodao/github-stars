Animate.css
===========

> If you need the old docs - v3.x.x and under - you can find it here.

_Just-add-water CSS animation_
------------------------------

Installation
------------

Install with npm:

npm install animate.css --save

Install with yarn:

yarn add animate.css

Getting Started
---------------

You can find the Animate.css documentation on the website.

Accessibility
-------------

Animate.css supports the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query so that users with motion sensitivity can opt out of animations. On supported platforms (currently all the majors browsers and OS), users can select "reduce motion" on their operating system preferences and it will turn off CSS transitions for them without any further work required.

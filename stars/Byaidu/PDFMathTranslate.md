3.2.\* Solutions for network issues in installation

Users in specific regions may encounter network difficulties when loading the AI model. The current program relies on the AI model (`wybxc/DocLayout-YOLO-DocStructBench-onnx`), and some users are unable to download it due to these network issues.

To address issues with downloading this model, use the following environment variable as a workaround:

set HF\_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com

For PowerShell user:

$env:HF\_ENDPOINT = https://hf-mirror.com

If the solution does not work to you / you encountered other issues, please refer to Frequently Asked Questions.

### 4.2 Downstream Development

For downstream applications, please refer to our document about \[API Details\](./docs/APIS.md) for further information about:

-   HTTP API, how to communicate with a server with the program installed

### 4.3 Differences between two major forks

-   Byaidu/PDFMathTranslate: The present and the original project for stable release.
    
-   PDFMathTranslate/PDFMathTranslate-next: A fork with web-ui and additional features. This fork handles a large number of marginal cases, improves PDF compatibility, and optimizes cross-column and cross-page semantic consistency, dynamic scaling, and dynamic scaling consistency, among many other translation quality improvements. However, this fork is intended solely for development and does not address compatibility issues and is not designed for community-contributions.

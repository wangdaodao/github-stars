The monospaced font for developers who like Minecraft a bit _too_ much.

If you'd like to see a vectorized version of this font, try Miracode!

_Notice: This project is not affiliated with Minecraft or Mojang in any way and is exclusively a fan project. This font emulates the typeface of the font used in the Minecraft UI, but it does not include any assets or font files from the original game._

FAQ

### What ligatures are available?

So far, the following ligatures have been added to the font:

And with the contributions of @Ciubix8513, Monocraft now includes continuous ligatures that enable you to type arrows and lines that _just keep going_.

If there is another character combination that you feel could be a ligature, feel free to create an issue!

### How are these characters generated?

Using FontForge's excellent Python extension, the glyphs are created from configuration files representing each character's pixels. Diacritics are created separately and are combined with the original characters to create over 500 unique glyphs. To learn more, check out the source code in the src folder.

### Do you have a version with the original Minecraft font (not monospaced)?

I've got you covered, check out my rendition of the Minecraft typeface here.

### What if I want to use a font that's actually good?

Understandable, check out Fira Code for a font with amazing attention to detail, or Scientifica for a bitmap font similar to this. Feel free to also check out my font Miracode for a font based on Monocraft that's a little more usable!

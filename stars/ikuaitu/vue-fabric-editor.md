Contribution guide
------------------

The project is committed to creating an out-of-the-box web image editor application, and at the same time, it will precipitate an encapsulation layer between the web image editor application and fabric.js. It is expected that the encapsulation layer will be designed for developers and provide a simpler interface so that developers can easily develop image applications.

If you are interested in this matter, we sincerely invite you to join us and grow together. You only need to know simple Git and Javascript syntax.

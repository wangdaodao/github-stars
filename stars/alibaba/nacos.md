Nacos: Dynamic _Na_ming and _Co_nfiguration _S_ervice
=====================================================

* * *

What does it do
---------------

Nacos (official site: nacos.io) is an easy-to-use platform designed for dynamic service discovery and configuration and service management. It helps you to build cloud native applications and microservices platform easily.

Service is a first-class citizen in Nacos. Nacos supports almost all type of services，for example，Dubbo/gRPC service, Spring Cloud RESTFul service or Kubernetes service.

Nacos provides four major functions.

-   **Service Discovery and Service Health Check**
    
    Nacos makes it simple for services to register themselves and to discover other services via a DNS or HTTP interface. Nacos also provides real-time health checks of services to prevent sending requests to unhealthy hosts or service instances.
    
-   **Dynamic Configuration Management**
    
    Dynamic Configuration Service allows you to manage configurations of all services in a centralized and dynamic manner across all environments. Nacos eliminates the need to redeploy applications and services when configurations are updated, which makes configuration changes more efficient and agile.
    
-   **Dynamic DNS Service**
    
    Nacos supports weighted routing, making it easier for you to implement mid-tier load balancing, flexible routing policies, flow control, and simple DNS resolution services in the production environment within your data center. It helps you to implement DNS-based service discovery easily and prevent applications from coupling to vendor-specific service discovery APIs.
    
-   **Service and MetaData Management**
    
    Nacos provides an easy-to-use service dashboard to help you manage your services metadata, configuration, kubernetes DNS, service health and metrics statistics.

Motrix
======

A full-featured download manager
--------------------------------

English | 简体中文

Motrix is a full-featured download manager that supports downloading HTTP, FTP, BitTorrent, Magnet, etc.

Motrix has a clean and easy to use interface. I hope you will like it 👻.

✈️ Official Website | 📖 Manual

💽 Installation
---------------

Download from GitHub Releases and install it.

### Windows

It is recommended to install Motrix using the installation package (Motrix-Setup-x.y.z.exe) to ensure a complete experience, such as associating torrent files, capturing magnet links, etc.

If you use package management tools to manage applications on Windows, such as Chocolatey, scoop. You can use them to install Motrix.

#### Chocolatey

Thanks to @Yato for continuing to maintain the Motrix Chocolatey package. To install motrix, run the following command from the `command line` or from `PowerShell`:

# Install
choco install motrix

# Upgrade
choco upgrade motrix

#### scoop

If you prefer the portable version, you can use scoop (need Windows 7+) to install Motrix.

scoop bucket add extras
scoop install motrix

### macOS

The macOS users can install Motrix using `brew`, thanks to PR of @Mitscherlich.

brew update && brew install motrix

#### Auto Update

Since Motrix v1.8.0 and later versions changed the App BundleID ( `net.agalwood.Motrix` => `app.motrix.native` ), the automatic update of Motrix v1.6.11 will fail. Motrix Install Assistant will help you install the latest Motrix application.

### Linux

You can download the `AppImage` (for all Linux distributions) or `snap` to install Motrix, see GitHub/release for more Linux installation package formats.

Motrix may need to run with `sudo` for the first time in Linux because there is no permission to create the download session file (`/var/cache/aria2.session`).

If you want to build from source code, please read the **Build** section.

#### AppImage

The latest version of Motrix AppImage requires you to manually perform desktop integration. Please check the documentation of AppImageLauncher .

> Desktop Integration Since electron-builder 21 desktop integration is not a part of produced AppImage file. AppImageLauncher is the recommended way to integrate AppImages.

Deepin 20 Beta users failed to install Motrix, please follow the steps below:

Open the `Terminal`, paste and run the following command to install Motrix again.

sudo apt --fix-broken install

#### Snap

Motrix has been listed on Snapcraft , Ubuntu users recommend downloading from the Snap Store.

Tips for v1.5.10

The tray may not display the indicator normally, which makes it inconvenient to exit the application.

Please unchecked Preferences--Basic Settings--Hide App Menu (Windows & Linux Only), click Save & Apply. Then click "Exit" in the File menu to exit the application.

Please update to v1.5.12 and above, you can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + q to quickly exit the application.

#### AUR

For Arch Linux users, Motrix is available in aur, thanks to the maintainer @weearc.

Run the following command to install:

yay -S motrix

#### Flatpak

Thanks to the PR of @proletarius101, Motrix has been listed Flathub, Linux users who like the Flatpak can try it.

flatpak install flathub net.agalwood.Motrix

# Run
flatpak run net.agalwood.Motrix

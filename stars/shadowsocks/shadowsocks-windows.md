PAC
---

-   The PAC rules are generated from the geosite database in v2fly/domain-list-community.
-   Generation modes: whitelist mode and blacklist mode.
-   Domain groups: `geositeDirectGroups` and `geositeProxiedGroups`.
    -   `geositeDirectGroups` is initialized with `cn` and `geolocation-!cn@cn`.
    -   `geositeProxiedGroups` is initialized with `geolocation-!cn`.
-   To switch between different modes, modify the `geositePreferDirect` property in `gui-config.json`
    -   When `geositePreferDirect` is false (default), PAC works in whitelist mode. Exception rules are generated from `geositeDirectGroups`. Unmatched domains goes through the proxy.
    -   When `geositePreferDirect` is true, PAC works in blacklist mode. Blocking rules are generated from `geositeProxiedGroups`. Exception rules are generated from `geositeDirectGroups`. Unmatched domains are connected to directly.
-   Starting from 4.3.0.0, shadowsocks-windows defaults to whitelist mode with Chinese domains excluded from connecting via the proxy.
-   The new default values make sure that:
    -   When in whitelist mode, Chinese domains, including non-Chinese companies' Chinese CDNs, are connected to directly.
    -   When in blacklist mode, only non-Chinese domains goes through the proxy. Chinese domains, as well as non-Chinese companies' Chinese CDNs, are connected to directly.

### User-defined rules

-   To define your own PAC rules, it's recommended to use the `user-rule.txt` file.
-   You can also modify `pac.txt` directly. But your modifications won't persist after updating geosite from the upstream.
